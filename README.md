# Enterprise Network Design with Dynamic Routing, VLAN Segmentation, and ASA Firewall Security

## Objective
The objective of this project was to design and implement a secure, enterprise-grade, multi-site network using Cisco routers, multilayer switches, and an ASA 5506-X firewall. The deployment incorporated dynamic routing protocols (OSPF and EIGRP), VLAN segmentation, DHCP configuration, SSH-enabled remote access, and extended ACLs to enforce interdepartmental isolation. The ASA firewall was configured to provide secure outbound internet connectivity using NAT, protocol inspection, and dynamic route exchange with internal routers via EIGRP. The overall design focused on layered security, traffic control, and operational scalability.

## Project Outcome 
Successfully designed and deployed a secure, scalable enterprise network featuring VLAN segmentation, DHCP services, and dynamic routing using both OSPF and EIGRP. Enabled secure remote device access via SSH and implemented ACLs to enforce interdepartmental access control. The ASA 5506-X firewall was configured with NAT, protocol inspection, and dynamic EIGRP route exchange to provide secure outbound connectivity. Full functionality was verified through connectivity tests, routing table validation, and policy enforcement, ensuring a robust and secure network environment.

 ### Phase Three: ACLs 
 To enforce department-based segmentation and limit unnecessary lateral communication between devices, access control lists (ACLs) were configured on the routers. These ACLs restrict traffic based on source/destination IP addresses and are applied to specific interfaces to control access to network resources such as servers and printers.
 #### Router2 
- Standard ACLs were configured to allow only specific departmental IP ranges to access the Sales/Marketing and Finance/Operations servers.
- Applied inbound on the interface connected to SW1 (MLSW1) hosting the servers.
- Ensures only authorized VLANs can communicate with the servers; all other access is denied.

  *Standard IP access lists on R2 used to permit only specific department subnets to access Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Operations servers.*
  
 #### Router3
- Extended ACLs were configured to enforce strict printer access control.
- Each departmentâ€™s PC can only communicate with its designated printer VLAN.
- ACLs were applied to the appropriate subinterfaces for each VLAN.
